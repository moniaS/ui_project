## Platform for sharing resources among students
### Usage of application requires HTTP server.
We were using Apache server which is included in XAMPP (to download: https://www.apachefriends.org/pl/index.html).
Project has to be in htdocs directory in localization, where XAMPP was installed.
We can start using application by entering URL: http://localhost/pages/login.html (http://localhost/pages/index.html).
